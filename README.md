# Weather-App
Developed a Weather App using Kotlin. It utilizes a weather API to fetch weather details and leverages the Volley library for making API requests. The app also integrates the Picasso library for fetching and displaying weather images. It provides real-time weather information based on the user's location or a manually entered location.
